# Review from Luca, Josh, Louis, Michael

## i. Interest of content
- "They actually found some interesting stuff"
- Forester is cool
- Citations and references as well as image attribution! 🎉
- Actual text content is in-depth and comprehensive
- Images are relevant and not excessive
**Rating: Perfect**

## ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
- We love `index.html` - very cool, hip and modern web page
- Excellent use of Bootstrap across files in coordination with a standard css file
- Uniform layout and spacing across pages
- Padding/alignment on the About the Author and Citations sections bugs me slightly 😢 but 
  spacing is a pain so this is understandable
- Page loads well on mobile devices (thanks to Bootstrap!)
**Rating: Exemplary**

## iii. Quality of written presentation
- Filesystem is clean with no junk or redundant files
- Text is well separated and easy to read
- Very few/if any spelling/grammar mistakes
- Images use src instead of local storage - potential persistence issue but more than good enough 
  for this project and for attribution
**Rating: Perfect**

## iv. Validity of HTML
- Minor bug: `foresters.html` is missing the required BootStrap JS to make the navbar work - 
  pressing the three bars on smaller viewports does nothing
- doctype, charset and lang tags are included to make valid html
- Note that Safari does not support the `background-attachment: fixed;` so the `index.html` is a little 
  less exciting on those (inferior) mobile devices 😂
- Consistent use of 2 spaces across all HTML files
- Line lengths are a little long in some cases (i.e. over 100 chars)
- No unnecessary or polluting white space
- One `img` tag in `foresters.html` (line 42) is missing a required `alt` tag, but now we're just 
  nitpicking
**Rating: Outstanding**

## v. Evidence of collaboration
- No use of GitHub PRs, Projects or Issues to manage task collaboration - merging into main is 
  fine just could be a little more over-viewable with reviewers, etc.
- Descriptive commit messages throughout although these don't adhere to imperative style
  e.g. `💬 Add detail to page`, `💄 Change styling of navbar`. Use emoji for added flair!
- No last minute commits - project was completed in good time 👍
- Author information is included at the bottom of all pages
- Commits seem slightly unbalanced but this is likely just the repo-owner styling the project etc.

**Rating: Excellent**
